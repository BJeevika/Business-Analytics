In recent years, the area of sports analytics has expanded dramatically as teams and organizations have sought to acquire a competitive advantage through the use of data and technology. This research paper throws light on the overall overview of the present state of sports analytics, including types of data as well as techniques used, the benefits and challenges, and case studies of successful implementation. In accordance with the findings, sports analytics has a significant deal of potential to enhance performance, strategy, and decision-making in the sporting world. The research aimed to automate the process of team formation for cricket matches by generating valid combinations of players based on their roles, budget constraints and inclusion of certain players in a team. The team formation was followed by prediction of number of average runs that can be scored with these new teams based on the historical data of these players of those teams using linear regression. The study involved cluster analysis of player performance data and resulted in the identification of four distinct clusters based on player roles. 
The findings revealed that the model was effective in generating valid team formations for the given constraints. The results also highlighted the importance of considering player roles and budget constraints in team formation, as these factors can significantly impact team performance.
The study has several implications for the cricket industry, including the potential to improve team performance and enhance fan engagement by creating more balanced and competitive matches. The model also has the potential to save time and resources for team management by automating the team formation process.
Conclusively, this study offers a significant contribution to the sports analytics domain through its provision of a data-centric strategy for forming cricket teams. The study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in generating valid team formations and highlights the importance of considering player roles and budget constraints in team formation along with the interest of inclusion of certain player(s) in a team.
